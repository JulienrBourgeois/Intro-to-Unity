# Intro-to-Unity
My intro to Unity was amazing! I started off completing the base Unity course on unity learn in just under 2 months. After that, I began to dive into several little mini projects. Unfortunately, I do not have visuals on all of these projects. Here is where I will talk them out and post the visuals that I do have on my intro to Unity programming! Because there were so many different topics that I did personal projects on in Unity, I will separate this read me into sections.
